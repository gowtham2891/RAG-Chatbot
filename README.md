Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo
Project Overview
This project showcases the development of a cutting-edge Retriever-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot utilizing OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo model. The chatbot is designed to enhance the processing and querying of textual data within PDF documents, representing a significant advancement in natural language processing. It employs a dynamic retrieval mechanism that interfaces seamlessly with a sophisticated vector storage system (FAISS).

Features
PDF Processing: The chatbot processes a local PDF document by dividing the content into manageable chunks.
Vector Conversion: Each chunk is converted into vectors that encapsulate the semantic essence of the text, facilitating advanced query handling.
Vector Storage: These vectors are stored in a FAISS vector store, designed for efficient similarity search and retrieval of high-dimensional data.
Query Response: Utilizing the LangChain framework, the chatbot leverages the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to retrieve relevant document vectors and generate accurate and contextually relevant responses to user queries.
User Interface: A Streamlit-based interface allows users to interact with the chatbot and receive responses.
Key Achievements
Developed a fully functional RAG system integrating seamlessly with FAISS and GPT-3.5 Turbo for optimized information retrieval and response accuracy.
Utilized LangChain to coordinate the interaction between the LLM model and the vector store, enhancing the system's ability to understand and respond to complex queries based on the content of the provided PDF.
Demonstrated significant improvement in the chatbotâ€™s ability to provide precise answers by leveraging real-time data retrieval from the structured vector database.
Created a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to facilitate user interaction with the chatbot.
Project Workflow
PDF Processing:

The chatbot initially processes a local PDF document by dividing the content into manageable chunks.
Vector Conversion:

Each chunk is converted into vectors that encapsulate the semantic essence of the text.
Vector Storage:

These vectors are stored in a FAISS vector store, enabling efficient similarity search and retrieval of high-dimensional data.
Query Response:

Using the LangChain framework, the chatbot leverages the GPT-3.5 Turbo model to retrieve relevant document vectors and generate accurate responses to user queries.
Usage
Load PDF:

The provided local PDF document is processed automatically.
Ask Questions:

Enter your query in the provided input box.
Get Responses:

The chatbot processes your query, retrieves relevant document vectors, and generates a response.
Technologies Used
